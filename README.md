The project  uses Zero-Shot Predictions from OpenAi:
https://github.com/openai/CLIP

The project uses images from Sketchy Database dataset:
https://github.com/CDOTAD/SketchyDatabase?tab=readme-ov-file

The goal is to use ploty dash (https://dash.plotly.com/) to analyze the clip model on sketches.

my_clip: Analyzes images from the assets folder using the CLIP model and stores the results in a CSV file named results.csv. It will overwrite the existing results.csv file every run.

my_fig: Creates a bar graph using Plotly Dash to visualize the number of correct and incorrect predictions for all classes. The data for this visualization is retrieved from the results.csv file, which was generated by the my_clip script.
